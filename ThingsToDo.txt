Ideas:
* Create database for tape archives
* Be able to create, update, delete people list
* Create Add, Delete and Update for every database
	= Tape Database
	= Master List Database
	= People Database
* REWORK CHECKING DB's FOR INFO, USE SCALERS FOR CHECKING


- Create Layout for Input, Search, Edit, Stats (possibly in tabs or upper bar)
- Create way to select Master from dropdown and display all projects on media
- Be able to create a new listing for a master archive
- Dropdown for person that entered in new listings
- Status updated at the bottom of the window as interface
- Add a backup feature that backs everything up every month or so
- Add export and import feature for database
- Change functions from database to return an array or list or hash
- Be able to save the old databases and recall them if needed
