Ideas:
* Create database for tape archives
* Be able to create, update, delete people list
* Create Add, Delete and Update for every database
	= Tape Database
	= Master List Database
	= People Database
	= Projects Database
	= MasterArchiveVideos Database
* change all camera dropdowns to get list from one source
* REWORK CHECKING DB's FOR INFO, USE SCALERS FOR CHECKING
* View tags as seperated objects instead of just seeing the comma, but save them as they are csv
* Take tag list and make comma seperated string
* Create import of xdcam master csv files
* Create a MasterArchiveVideos for all videos that have been mastered
* Create a table that keeps deleted info
* Create a more extensive search to include all databases
* Be able to create a new listing for a master archive
* Dropdown for person that entered in new listings
* Add project add, update, delete form
* Add function to update tapelist Master when mastered videos are imported or entered
* Use Enum to create Deleted data retreival Form for all of the data that has deleted data
* Create functions to load all deleted data for each deleted database
* Create panel of each deleted database for the form
* Add deletion of deleted entries once they have been reinstated
* check dropdowns for camera and master list and delete default collection
* Add MasterArchiveVideo add, update, delete form
* Add filter to search listview


- Create Layout for Input, Search, Edit, Stats (possibly in tabs or upper bar)
- Create way to select Master from dropdown and display all projects on media
- Status updated at the bottom of the window as interface
- Add a backup feature that backs everything up every month or so
- Add export and import feature for database
- Be able to save the old databases and recall them if needed
- Automatically add project name to project numbers from the projects DB
- PUT TRY STATEMENTS AROUND SQL stuff

60, 200, 120, 50, 50, 62, 78, 95, 60
